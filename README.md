# Cube
Final project of my undergraduation program.

Robot that uses a webcam to take pictures of the sides of the rubik's cube and
creates a virtual model of it.
It is possible to create any model by changing the colors of the cube in the program.

The cube can be solved by two methods, the layer methods, with a lot of rotations
and another method that is near to the optimal.

This project used brownan cube solver: https://github.com/brownan/Rubiks-Cube-Solver
and Alyssaq squares.cpp: https://github.com/alyssaq/opencv

Remember to give permissions to format.sh and run.sh in Rubik-Cube-Solver folder.
